# BLK360 laser scanning of rainforests

**In 2019, a permanent 12-ha rainforest plot in East Amazonia, called “Petit Plateau”, was scanned using two BLK360 laser scanners. <br/>
A new algorithm was then developed for detecting tree stems from the laser scanning data. <br/>
36,422 stems were detected, of which 29,665 (81%) were in the 3-10 cm DBH range.**<br/>

Point cloud files of the plot and the detected stems are available at:
